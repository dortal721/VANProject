### Video Aided Navigation project ### 

This repository contains the implementation of my final project for the 'SLAM - Video Navigation' course at HUJI. 

The objective of the project is to build a vision-based navigating system, such that would be able to evaluate the relative movement of the test car along the trajectory.  

### System Input ### 
***
As input, the system gets stereo images, provided by the KITTI project. The input images were taken using the KITTI project car, which is equipped with a stereo camera sensor:
